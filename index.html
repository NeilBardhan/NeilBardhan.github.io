	<p class="blurb">I am an Information Science Graduate from the University of Pittsburgh specializing in Big Data Analytics. I am a passionate problem solver with an appetite for challenging problems. I love working with data and listening to the stories the data tells me. I find profound joy in discovering the hidden patterns in large, complex datasets using statistical methods of analyses and understanding the greater context behind those patterns.
I have extensive experience with Big Data Technologies like Apacha Spark/Hadoop and am proficient in programming in Python, R and Scala. I am currently looking for Full Time opportunities in Data Science and Analytics. I invite you to go through my website to better understand my past <a href="/projects">projects</a> and <a href="/resume">experiences</a>.

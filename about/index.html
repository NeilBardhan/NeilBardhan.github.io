        During the 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic, my home city of Pune in Western India was among the hardest hit. Being the first city in India to report fatalities, the then local administration had little option but to order schools and colleges to close their doors for a week in a bid to stem the contagion. It was during this unwelcome break that I chanced upon a news article on bbc.com that claimed that the internet search giant, Google, could predict the spread of the influenza in real time by analyzing the three billion search queries it received every day. It was the first time I had heard of Data Analytics. Since then, I have been captivated by the power embedded in the everyday data that we generate and by the patterns concealed in that data. These hidden patterns hold the solutions to some of humankind’s most profound problems. It is in search for these solutions that I have decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Information Science with a Big Data Analytics Specialization from the University of Pittsburgh.

Over the course of my undergraduate studies at the University of Pune I have had the opportunity to study subjects such as Data Structures, Database Management Systems, Software Engineering and Computer Networks. All these subjects have helped me get a brief overview of the various areas that encompass Computer Science and out of all these areas I found the processing, modelling and analysis of data to be the most appealing.

India suffers from a plethora of health issues reporting the highest number of viral infections of rabies and hepatitis A as well as accounting for more than 50% of the world’s tuberculosis deaths. In 2009, Google was able to predict the spread of the H1N1 influenza in developed countries with 97% accuracy, arming public health officials with priceless information. However, during the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, these systems failed miserably. The reason being, that most people in the impoverished West African region have little or no access to internet, read Google’s, services. Indeed, the ebola epicentres of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea rank bottom in the list of countries with internet penetration. The majority of health workers in the Asian subcontinent (and also perhaps in West Africa) come from a low-literate background and are at the forefront in the fight against these diseases. Therefore, it is essential that epidemiological forecasting models be designed keeping these constraints in mind. Under the tutelage of the faculty of Pittsburgh’s iSchool I hope to assist in the development of disease progression forecasting systems that can overcome these challenges and help developing countries such as India and Liberia step up their fight against these deadly viral diseases.

I have chosen to pursue graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh because I believe that my abilities will flourish in the hands of its distinguished faculty. Because the University boasts of one of the first Data Analytics oriented courses being offered at the graduate level, I am confident that I will be able to make enduring contributions to the field of Big Data Analytics.

        I plan to use my Master’s degree as a stepping stone for a Doctorate. I intend to share my experiences and learning by taking up a research-oriented post in either R and D laboratories or academia. Achieving these goals, however, requires that I undergo a rigorous graduate study program under the guidance of some of the best minds in the Data Science field. Therefore, I consider your Master’s program to be a significant step in my overall growth and progression, and look forward to joining your University for pursuing higher studies. I am very grateful for your consideration of my application.
